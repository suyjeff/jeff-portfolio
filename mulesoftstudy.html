                <p class="whitebg-header" style="padding-top: 100px;">A platform is more than its products</p>
                <p class="whitebg-text">For complex, time-sensitive projects, MuleSoft's Anypoint Platform offers dozens of compelling products in a fast and capable environment. 
                    For small and large teams alike, the Anypoint suite was more than enough to manage their integrations and APIs. 
                    However, what the platform excelled at in its products, it lacked in cohesiveness. 
                    Suites like Google Drive and Office 365 succeed in part because of their excellent tools, but perhaps more so because 
                    their users understand how those tools connect and function as a platform. This wasn't the case for Anypoint; users 
                    commonly excelled within certain tools, but failed to understand how these tools could work t
                    ogether to create a more productive workflow.

                <p class="whitebg-text">Internal research and user interviews showed us that most people <span class="semibolder">didn't even use</span> the Anypoint Platform’s home page. 
                    Most of them directly entered the first tool in their workflow and jumped between their necessary tools without ever touching home base. 
                    Was this efficient? Definitely not. But with most users being unaware of the best practices on the platform, they 
                    were left "hopping" between all of the different tools–often without direction.

                        <p class="gradbg-text">In order to get more context on the home page's problems, I consulted 
                            previously conducted internal design reviews, user research on platform navigation, usability studies, 
                            and had conversations with other MuleSoft workers who could speak from the perspective of our wide user base. <br> <br>
                            These contextual searches gave way to a few prominent issues, but one sentiment was more present than anything else: 
                            feeling "lost". The lack of interconnectedness left users feeling lost when trying to find features, lost in a sea of 
                            tools when trying to reach their projects, and ultimately confused–especially for newer users.

                <p class="whitebg-text">Armed with new sentiments and research, I hypothesized that helping our users find their place in the 
                    Anypoint Platform would require centering my designs around improving the user journey throughout the platform. 
                    This would come through <span class="semibolder">establishing more contextual navigation</span>, helping users <span class="semibolder">consume their content rather than 
                        hop between tools</span>, and <span class="semibolder">reducing the barrier of entry</span> for new users. Recentering the home page around workflows and 
                    projects should result in all users experiencing the MuleSoft promise of fast and easy integrations and APIs.

                <p class="whitebg-header" style="padding-top: 50px;">Pushing productivity first</p>
                <p class="whitebg-text" style="padding-bottom: 100px; margin-bottom: 0;">The Anypoint Platform's core idea was that efficiency and interconnectedess are the basis for producing critical 
                    integrations and managing APIs at any scale. It was important that the experience also be focused around integrations and how tools can work 
                    together, rather than individually.

                <p class="gradbg-text" style="padding-bottom: 100px; margin-bottom: 0;">It was clear that our users often got lost searching for important actions in the platform; 
                    they were hard to find as they were usually stashed away in menus within Anypoint's various tools. To alleviate 
                    these pains and give users a more centralized point of control, I designed a new "quick start" component. Using 
                    his, we could offer users personalized content guides and task flow starting points. This helps them jump into the 
                    platform more easily if they're a new user, or move through their work more efficiently if they're more experienced.

                <p class="whitebg-text" style="padding-bottom: 100px; margin-bottom: 0;">To access their projects, users needed to dive into the navigation drawer's 
                    recent items or list or dive into their tool from the home page and then navigate further to their project. 
                    This not only slowed down their workflow, but more importantly, made users feel like their work 
                    was siloed into a bunch of different tools rather than on one fluid platform. Showing our users 
                    their most recent projects and suggesting potential next steps saves time and helps users understand how the web of tools collaborate.

                <p class="gradbg-text" style="padding-bottom: 100px; margin-bottom: 0;">As a new intern at MuleSoft, I had to undergo a week of training in the 
                    Anypoint Platform to fully grasp its capabilities. It was through this training period where I realized the importance of a 
                    modular home page that could grow with the user. As most users don't have the same amount of experience with APIs and integrations, 
                    the home page will change which resources, quick start items, tools, and more that it displays. Additionally, the new home page changes 
                    how those items are displayed, ensuring that no user is left in the dark about any tool or functionality.

                <p class="gradbg-header" style="padding-top: 90px;">Productivity in motion</p>
                <p class="gradbg-text" style="padding-bottom: 60px; margin-bottom: 0;">Platforms are about more than their tools. The most successful in the productivity 
                    sector are often those that, along with polished and useful products, are easy for users to understand and grasp. For the Anypoint Platform, 
                    users needed an anchor that could help them establish a deeper understanding of the platform while also adding long needed 
                    features that could improve work flows. As I worked on this project, it became more and more about empowering users to see the platform 
                    differently, rather than just a redesign. Ultimately, the redesign has received lots of positive feedback from the larger design team, 
                    internal stakeholders, and representatives of customer groups. Hopefully, this can be the push in productivity that enables the 
                    Anypoint Platform to reach new heights. <br> <br>
