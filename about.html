                <pre class="article-text">
                    I'm driven by the idea that everyone should have access to the technologies that are changing the world. Because of this, I strive to design products that push the needle forward, but don't leave anyone behind. I love creating great experiences that make me think about the problems people around the world are facing, and how to solve them elegantly.

                    So far, I've lead the design of web and mobile apps for Onfo; led redesigns of the shopping experience for ShareRails; led designs and created a design system for Welfie; and worked as a UX design intern at MuleSoft, a Salesforce company.

                    I'm currently a student at Washington University in St. Louis, where I try to push my own limits and learn more about the world. On the side, I enjoy everything NBA, winning DotA 2 games, chewing gum, and eating chicken salad sandwhiches everywhere they're sold.
